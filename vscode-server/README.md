# VS Code Server

The Visual Studio Code Server is a service you can run on a remote development machine, like your desktop PC or a virtual machine (VM). It allows you to securely connect to that remote machine from anywhere through a vscode.dev URL, without the requirement of SSH.

This is simply a containerized version of the VS Code Server.
